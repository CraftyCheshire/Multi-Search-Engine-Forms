# Multi-Search-Engine-Forms
# Part 1: Creating the Webpage
## Create a New Repository:

1. On GitHub, create a new repository named Multi-Search-Engine-Forms.
2. Initialize this repository with a README.md file.
3. Clone your new repository to your local machine.

## Develop the Webpage:

1. Create an index.html file in your repository.
2. Design three separate forms within the webpage:
- One form should submit queries to Google (https://www.google.com/search).
- The second form should target Bing (https://www.bing.com/search).
- The third form should direct queries to Yahoo (https://search.yahoo.com/search).
3. Each form should include:
- A text input field for the search query.
- A submit button.
4. Configure the action and method attributes of each form appropriately.
5. Ensure the query input fields have the name attribute set correctly (usually "q").
6. Include comments in the code explaining the purpose of each form element and attribute.
